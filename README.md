# LPHYS2267-Impact of changes in insolation and CO2 on Climate

### Why this repository ? 
GitHub made for the Project : **Investigate the impacts of changes in insolation and CO2 on climate based on
model simulations** of the LPHYS2267 - Paleoclimate dynamics and modelling class. 

The goal of this project is to : 

- Diagnose the outputs of the LOVECLIM climate model
- Understand what are the majors impacts of precession and CO2 on some fundamental climate variables such as temperature, precipitation and sea ice. 

More informations can be found in the *Instructions* folder. 

The final report around these questions and the analysis can be found in the https://fr.overleaf.com/read/wbqcnrcmzshr. This project has been done by Élise Françoisse, Augustin Lambotte and Amaury Laridon.
